Welcome to the AQUA-Protocol.

## What is it and why use it?

AQUA is a reference implementation to enable data-accounting and with it an effective way to enable peer-to-peer trusted data-generation and exchange. This is useful to fight fake-news, deepfakes, social-engineering and more and can be used to build peer-to-peer institutions and organisations.

The primary goal of aqua to enable trusted and sovereign control of your digital domain. This is achieved by combining the AQUA-Protocol with a knowledge-container architecture to store your data fully locally by default.

* **What is it *not yet* good for?**: This is an implementation which is ment for exploration of new design principles and to accelerate the development of such infrastructure. This prototype is not production grade software and should be avoided to be used outside of pilots.
